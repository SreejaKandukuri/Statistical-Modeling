The projects involved working with two distinct datasets: the COVID-19 dataset and the National Hurricane Center dataset. On the COVID-19 dataset, various statistical analyses were conducted, including t-tests, hypothesis testing for p-values, two-sample t-tests, and linear regression. Similarly, the National Hurricane Center dataset was utilized for performing inferential statistics, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing, among other statistical methods.
